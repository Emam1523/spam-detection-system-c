# Email Spam Detection

This project is an implementation of an email spam detection model using the Logistic Regression algorithm in C. The model analyzes email content to classify messages as either spam or not spam based on various features extracted from the text.

## Features

- **Language**: C
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
- **Purpose**: Classify emails as spam or not ham

## Usage

1. Compile the C code.
2. Run the executable with the email dataset.
3. The model will output the classification results.

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Email dataset for training and testing

## Installation

```sh
gcc -o main main.c
./main dataset.txt
```
